# Connect Four AI Game
This project is a Connect Four game where players can either:

Play against an AI-powered robot
Watch two robots compete against each other using Monte Carlo and Minimax algorithms
The game uses a Next.js front-end and a Flask back-end, integrated with SocketIO for real-time communication.
